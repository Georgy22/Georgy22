Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nwaneri Georginia, I'm a newbie in tech and an aspiring frontend web developer currently enrolled on alx SE program.
I am familiar with some basic concepts of Git, I love GitHub.

I am also learning the "New responsive web design" course in freecodecamp and have succeeded in completing one of the certification task.
